# Sales-prediction-Internship-Project
Sales Prediction Web App  Machine learning-based sales prediction web app created during an internship. Input data to predict future sales. Built with Python and Streamlit.
This repository hosts a machine learning-driven sales prediction web application developed as part of an internship project. The application, built with Streamlit and Python, allows users to input various parameters related to sales data, such as product information, country, shipping details, and discounts. It leverages a pre-trained machine learning model to predict future sales based on the provided inputs. This project serves as a practical example of deploying a machine learning model within a user-friendly web interface. Explore, contribute, and learn more about sales prediction and machine learning deployment.
